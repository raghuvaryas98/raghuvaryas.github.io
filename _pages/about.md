I am an Engineer by profession and a tech enthusiast. As a Linux Embedded Software Engineer at Qualcomm Incorporated, I thrive on the forefront of technology, immersing myself in the development of cutting-edge technologies. I have worked on developing a wide range of IoT and wearable products across extended reality (XR), smart audio, smart cameras, and robotics. Holding a Master of Technology (M.Tech) in Software Systems from BITS Pilani, my academic focus has centered on Embedded Systems, Cloud Computing, and AI. Prior to this, I received my Bachelor of Engineering (B.E) degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering from RV College of Engineering, Bangalore.

Beyond my professional pursuits, I embrace an extroverted nature, finding joy in traveling to immerse myself in diverse cultures. Exploring culinary delights wherever I roam fuels my passion for travel, while back at home, I delight in experimenting with new recipes in the kitchen. During weekends, I relish urban exploration, seeking out hidden gems within the city, and cherish moments of solitude indulging in music, swimming, or engaging in a spirited game of badminton with friends.

Welcome to this space where I weave together the tapestry of my personal and professional experiences through blogs.

Thank you for joining me on this journey, and I hope you find inspiration and enjoyment within these pages :)
